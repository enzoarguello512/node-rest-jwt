      'Instead of crostini, try gluten-free polenta squares as the base for a variety of toppings. Creamy polenta becomes perfectly firm once chilled; it will hold its shape when sliced and seared. The result is a golden brown crust outside and a creamy, not rubbery, texture inside. We top ours with a funky Gorgonzola cheese, balsamic reduction, faintly sweet dried currants, and pine nuts. You could substitute chopped dried figs or cranberries for the currants, or come up with your own flavor combo. Try diced marinated tomato and basil, sautéed mushrooms and garlic, or more substantial shredded pork shoulder.',

These beautiful canapés start with a base of candy cane (or Chioggia) beet squares, whose alternating ruby and white rings are stunning. (You can add more color to the platter by alternating candy cane beet and golden beet slices.) The beet stays raw, so the slices are crunchy and sweet and hold up nicely. The jewel-like topping of easy-to-find salmon caviar turns what's truly a simple make-ahead nibble into an absolute work of art that'll make you the talk of your social circle.",

Ditch the sodium-bomb seasoning packets and sour cream-and-mayonnaise–laden dip (which can pack a small meal’s worth of calories and sat fat into a single serving) for our homemade dip. And be patient with the caramelizing process—slowly sizzled onions have noteworthy sweetness and concentrated umami. And because no dip is complete without a dipper, baked sweet potatoes will satisfy your chip craving for half the calories of most bagged varieties.',
